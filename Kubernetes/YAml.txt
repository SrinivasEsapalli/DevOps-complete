YAMl:
 Pods and services etc are represented in YAML format..

Dictonaries - unordered and list and arrays are ordered..

Types of YAML format:

Dictionary inside dictionary
 
  ex:

2) LIST
when we are storing different cars then we are using list..
 Ex: 
   Car
     - blue Toyota
     - Green Toyota
     - Black Toyota
3)LIST OF Dictionaries..
if we have to store all the details of each car then in this case we can use the list of dictionaries string
