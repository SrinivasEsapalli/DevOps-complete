## Introduction
- It is Saas from micorsoft and it implements all your devOps processes.

## Features
There are five features in azure DevOps 
- Azure Boards
- Azure Repos
- Azure Pipeline
- Azure Test Plans
- Azure Artifacts

## Azure Boards
- We can create feature, features or fixes for our tasks.
- we can assign it to the people and we can track them.
- It helps to communicated with others within the task

## Azure Repos
- Similar to git to host the Code.
- It has Pull Rewuest, Branching features.
- Azure Repos Commit, Pull request or branch can be linked to the work items.

## Azure Pipeline
- Continuoes integration pipelines are written here using YAML.

### Pipeline Syntax.
#### Steps - Pipeline has steps it is the smallest building block of a pipeline.
- A step can either be a script or a task.
Ex: We want to test and package the application.
we will do the following in steps
- Run tests
- Package application
- Build docker image
- Push docker image
Each step executes a command.

#### Tasks 
- A Task is a pre-created script, Which you can use as a convinience.
- There are list of available tasks in the pipeline opened in YAMl Editor and we can add them into YAML pipeline.
- We can use them with set of inputs.


#### Jobs
- A Job runs on an agent.
- A job represents execution boundary of set of steps.
- All the steps in a job runs on a same agent.
Ex: Running the front end application, Running the backend application, Running a task on windows, Running a task on Linux.

#### Agent
- By default pipelines doesn't have any hardware or servers so it will use an exisisting server to run the pipeline.
- An Agent is computing infrastructure with software installed in it.
Ex: An agent can be anything an exisisting Ec2 instance, windows machine, Mac Machine etc.

#### Pool
- We specify what kind of os we are using or what kind of version we are using to Run the step or Job.

- Pipeline Runs the steps in parallel with Jobs.
- Pipelines Generates the artifacts.
### Stages
- A stage is a logical boundary in the pipeline.
- Each stage contains 1 or more jobs.
- There are different stages in the pipeline build stage, Deployment stage etc..

### Continuous Delivery/Deploy

 -> It is fully automated process of Automatically deploying the code changes into production environment.
 -> For Deployment we have deployment JOb.

 #### Templates
 - we can store repeatable/reusable code in on YAML file and we can use the code in all the stages or pipelines we can use templates for jobs,Stes also.
 - Template withing the template also possoble.

 Ex: - template: /Deploy/Jobs/deploy.yaml

 #### Environment
 - If we have multiple dev or tests or  prod with different versions are deployed with we get confused like on which version we are working so to avoid this environments are used.
- like we can tag them whether it's a development or production or testing pipeline.

EX: environment: Development.

#### Release pipeline
- Release pipelines are created by using UI not by YAML.

## Azure Artifacts 
- Artifacts differ based on the programming language used for writing the application.
ex: for java -> Jar files
.NET -> Nuget
Java script -> zip file or tar file etc..
- In Azure artifacts we can store and share different packages from punlic and private sources.

It supports three types of artifacts
- Maven packages
- Nuget Packages
- NPM Packages.

- We can store the Artifacts generated by build pipelines easily in the Azure Artifacts.

#### Irrespective of programming we are creating docker images as an artifacts.


## Azure Test Plans
- A browser-based test management tool
- Have a unified, Central view of your test cases.

Two types of tests
Manual Tests
- Specifying the test steps and expected outcomes.
Automated Tests
- Executed as the part of Azure pipelines and results are viewd in Azure test plans.
