HTTPS responses
Caching

### DNS
initially when we request for a website www.example.com DNS (domain name server). DNS will convert Domain names(example.com) of a particular application into machine reable IP address.  WWW. is the host name.

### PAckets: then everything on internet will send as packets
Packet will be send over TCP/Ip - SYN,SYN-ACK,ACK 3ways of handshake

### Security - SSL/TLS - security 
- SSL: Secure Sockets Layer
- TLS: Transport Layer Security
- The certificates will be used for handshake by using private key's these are authorized/signed by certificate authority(CI) 

### Packet requests HTTPS to get a  website 
- packet request a app server to get the website.

### Server processing 
- server will process

###  HTTPS responses
- gives the response
