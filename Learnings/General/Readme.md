## Application support team
- Roles and Responisbilitys of Application support team.

### Incident:
#### When application is down incident is created.
 if any application is down application support team needs to inform to users that application is down and we neeed to work with respctive for example server team. once the server team resolve this issue then we need to inform back the users that application is back.

    - we need check with server team what was the isseu.
    - why those are down.
    - What are the steps needs to be taken to overcome in the future.

#### we need to do above 3 steps for every issue.



## POC
 POC - Proof of concepts.
 - Gathering of the all the information. They will develop initial stage of an environment anf they will take care of things. This is like a dummy environment. we need to install the software. They estimate how much it will take to install the software. They will create this enivironment.
 - According to the work They decide the cost and time, resources,effort etc. They will find out everything while doing the POC.
- After POC they know everything like softwares, servers in and out of the project.


- Then they will build the environments UAT, TEST and PROD.


## Dr planning 
- Disaster Recovery planning
- This is an activity done every year once or twice according to the criticality of the application.
- If our data center is in Locataion A. If anything happens in Location A like earth quake. Again we need to recollect the data. That is our system has to go smoothly. No need of lossing of work. So that's why they planned to put other data center in other location.
- So one data center is in one location A and other one will be in different location B. 
- So yearly once they will make the other data center is upto date and they will use the data center   and they will work on it. so one day they will make that data center up and they will test few scenarios, applications and all. Then they will move back to original data center.
- Planning we have to do how the DR activity will goes.
