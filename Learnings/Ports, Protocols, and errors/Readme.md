## SendGrid:
Scenario: Password Reset Email in a Web App
You have a web application (e.g., a job portal or e-commerce site), and when a user forgets their password:

The user clicks "Forgot Password."

Your app sends an API request to SendGrid to send the password reset email.

SendGrid processes the request and sends the email using SMTP or HTTPS, applying security protocols like TLS.

The user receives the email within seconds in their inbox.

You can track whether the email was delivered, opened, or clicked using SendGrid‚Äôs webhooks or dashboard.

üì¶ Real-Time Use Cases of SendGrid:
Use Case	                               Example
Transactional Emails	                        Sending password resets, order confirmations, invoices, or OTPs from your application
Marketing Emails	                        Sending newsletters, promotions, or product updates to a list of subscribers
Email API Integration	                 Using SendGrid's Email API in a Node.js, Python, or .NET backend to send and track emails
Domain Authentication	                 Setting up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC via DNS so your emails don‚Äôt go to spam
Event Tracking	                        Tracking when users open your emails, click links, or unsubscribe


## What is TLS? (Transport Layer Security)
TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a cryptographic protocol used to secure data transmission over the internet. It ensures that data sent between two systems (like a browser and a web server or an email client and an email server) is encrypted, authenticated, and tamper-proof.

üí° Real-Time Examples of TLS
‚úÖ Example 1: Visiting a Secure Website
Scenario: You open https://www.amazon.com in your browser.

What Happens:

The browser initiates a TLS handshake with Amazon's server.

A secure connection is established.

All data (login credentials, payment info, etc.) is encrypted.

üîê TLS in Action: You see the padlock üîí icon in the browser's address bar.

‚úÖ Example 2: Sending Email with SendGrid (or Any SMTP Server)
Scenario: Your app sends a transactional email via SendGrid.

What Happens:

SendGrid connects to the recipient‚Äôs mail server using SMTP with STARTTLS.

If the recipient supports TLS 1.2 or higher, the connection is encrypted.

The email contents (subject, body, attachments) are protected from interception.



## DLL (dynamic library):

DLL (Dynamic Link Library) is a file format used in Windows operating systems that contains code and data that multiple programs can use simultaneously.

File extension: .dll

It helps with code reusability, modularity, and efficient memory usage.

üß† Real-Time Example of DLL Usage
‚úÖ Example 1: Microsoft Word Using a DLL for Printing
Scenario: You click ‚ÄúPrint‚Äù in Microsoft Word.

What Happens:

Word calls a Windows printing DLL (like winspool.drv) to interact with your printer.

The DLL handles the printing logic, so Microsoft Word doesn't need to include that code itself.

Tcp is like road we are using it to connect to the client and server.


The TCP protocol uses specific port numbers for different services. Some common default TCP ports include port 21 for FTP, port 22 for SSH, port 23 for Telnet, port 25 for SMTP, port 80 for HTTP, port 443 for HTTPS, and port 110 for POP3. 




## RPC ports
## RPC 135, 49152 - 655535( Remote Procedure call)
- These are general purpose ports Just the general communication from the Microsoft servers.
- RPC allows a program to execute code on a remote server. It is commonly used for communication between distributed systems, including windows services like DTC.
### RPC 135 - used to establish initial connection between client and server.

- 49152 - 655535( Remote Procedure call)  - used for further communication.

- RPC Enables DTC transactions, remote windows management, and active directory replication.


## Dynamic Ports
- These are temporary ports assigned by the OS. When an application or service requests a network connection.

- and are closed after the connection is closed.
- Port Ranage is 49152 - 65535.









## 100
- Indicates that the server has received the initial part of the request and the client should continue sending the rest. 

## 403
- 403 Forbidden: The server understands the request but refuses to authorize it. x`

## 500
- A 500 error, or "Internal Server Error," is a generic HTTP status code indicating a problem on the server-side, preventing it from fulfilling the request, and is not a user-side issue.


## Other

## Network Protocols
- These define how devices find and talk to each other over a network.

Protocol	                        Purpose	                                            Example

  ### TCP/IP
   - Initially application layer will have diffrenet protocols - SMTP, HTTP, FTP

   they will have their own port numbers (SMTP - 587, HTTP - 80, FTP- 20) so that trnsport layer will know it is comming from which application layer protocol.

- Then the data will be divided into small packets and transmitted to the destination where each packet have header codes etc.. it will formed as the original data(image etc.)

IP - Then packets will have Ip address so that it will have both sender and receivers IP address details.

then data is send to final network layer - MAC address etc..so that packets goes to right physical machines. 



## TCP/IP vs HTTPS ‚Äì What's the Difference

- TCP/IP is a low-level protocol suite that governs how data is transmitted over the internet or any network.

- HTTPS is a high-level protocol built on top of TCP/IP, specifically over HTTP using SSL/TLS encryption.

Think of it like this:

TCP/IP is the highway; HTTPS is a secure, armored car traveling on it.

## Other

## LDAPS
-  Light weight direct access protocol Secured.


- LDAP - transfer the data on plain text it is not secured, on port 389
- LDAPS - Light weight direct access protocol Secured. uses SSL certs for transmitting the data betweeen client and server.
       - It will encrypt the data and transmits it.
       - It uses port 636.
       - Certificates: Requires valid SSL/TLS certificates on the LDAP server. Clients may also need to trust the certificate authority (CA) issuing those certificates.
       - Secure authentication, user directory lookups, and access control integrations (e.g., with Active Directory, OpenLDAP).

## Servers - LDAP servers are servers that implement the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) 
Example servers are
Microsoft Active Directory (AD)	: Most widely used LDAP-compatible directory service for Windows environments.
OpenLDAP :  Open-source, highly customizable LDAP server implementation.
Apache Directory Server	: Java-based LDAP server, part of the Apache Software Foundation.
389 Directory Server	: Enterprise-class open-source LDAP server from Red Hat.
Oracle Internet Directory (OID) : LDAP implementation by Oracle for enterprise environments.


## Active Directory :
Active directory
- ADDS(active directory Domain services) - structured data store of objects
- Windows server and active directory
it's where user account are stored - we can stores there accounts in active directory such as username and password their address all kind info so that login and access data
- computer account will have stored in AD -  unified user details and computer credentials (paswrord and it does havbe severity identity)
- Groups - data store in active groups take user into group and we can give permission to groups, we can take comuter put them in to group or nesting groups, groups will make most administartors simple.
- other object (printers, shares, GPO) - printer easier to find for larger org, we can easily found in active directory.
