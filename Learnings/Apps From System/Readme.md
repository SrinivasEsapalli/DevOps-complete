### Event viewer and Windows event viewer difference
Event Viewer in Computer Management
Found under System Tools inside Computer Management (compmgmt.msc).

Provides a simplified view of system logs.

Less customization and fewer filtering options.

Useful for quick troubleshooting while managing other system components.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Standalone Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc)
Accessed separately via Run (Win + R) ‚Üí eventvwr.msc.

More detailed and customizable, allowing you to create custom views and advanced filters.

Provides deeper insights into system logs (Application, Security, System, Setup, etc.).

Supports subscriptions for forwarding logs from multiple systems.

üìå When to Use Which?

If you're already inside Computer Management, the built-in Event Viewer is convenient.

If you need advanced log analysis, filtering, or custom event subscriptions, use the full Event Viewer.
