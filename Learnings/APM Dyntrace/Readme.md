## INTRO

- APM - Application perfomrance monitoring(Management)

- It is used to monitor business critical application using some software tools.

- for customer satisfaction. It will helps to identify and resolve the issues quickly. helps to imporove customer satisfaction.
  we can pin point issues easily.

- Rapid Diagnosis - It will helps to ideentify the issues quickly and resolve them quickly, so that it will improves customer satisfaction and improves the performance of the application also helps to add new features.
- Reduced   operating costs - by using dynatrace IT teams get the idea what are infrastructure, what are resources required to reduce the application cost.

- Product development - Installs these in the Test and PROd environment to identify work loads and limitations of it, they can fix these before delievering to end user.

## FEATURES.

- These will help to track the application performance continuossly by checking response time error rates and through puts.

- Trasaction Tracing - Trace out the individual user transcations and finds issues and bottle necks.

- Root Cause Analysis - We can easily pin point the issue where it's occured and how we can resolve it ans we can also check how this problem will effects the business.

- Infrastructure Monitoring -  we can also get infra info like server performance, DB working, VM's etc..



## Benefits

- Tech Benefits
-Increased application stability and uptime - It will helps the business to identify the application perfomrance easily so they can avoid impacting original users.

- Reduced no of performance incidents.
- Faster resolutin of performance problems.
- Faster and Higher-quality software releases.
- Improved infra utilization  - resources are utilized same or less etc.


Business benefits:

- Improved dev and Operational productivity - time spent on errors will be less they can  focus on improving productivity etc..

- better user exp - resolve errors quickly etc and increases business and we know how infra is woring etc..



## Observability
APM - Monitoring and managing the performance of applications.
  based on time, error rates and transaction traces.

Obeservability - focuses more on wider view, understand complex systems.
  APM Metrics + logs events and traces.

 It focuses on overall systems behaviour.


## Dynatrace
-  Is a popular platform provides complete montoring, security  for application and infrastructure.
- It uses AI to automate the tasks and teams will get precise answers.
- monitoring, security etc make it into single platform.
- We can say it as all in one solution monitoring, security, analytics etc..



### Does
 - We can momitor infra servers, VM's, container, metwork, event logs and we can get all insights.
 - MTTR - Mean time to recovery (how fast we can recover from issues)
   we can reduce it using dyntrace.

- it will all components in infra regularly with help dyntrace 
- we can trace application end to end.


## Setup Dynatrace

- We need to install Dynatrace agent in all the servers like Web,App,DB etc.
- It willl monitors and sends using active gates to Dyntrace environment.
- all the data will be stored in active gates.
- Dyntrace users by usinh UI they will monitor all these.

- users need to take care of dynatrace environment as well.
